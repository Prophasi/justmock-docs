## Using JustMock

To start using JustMock in your test projects, add a reference to the __Telerik.JustMock.dll__. The assembly is located in the installation directory under the *Libraries* folder (by default C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik JustMock\Libraries). Respectively for .NET Core under *Libraries\netcoreapp2.0*.
Alternatively, use the [Visual Studio Extension]({%slug justmock/getting-started/visual-studio-extension%}).


## Resources and Documentation

After installing JustMock, you can find a Getting Started Guide and example projects in the installation directory (by default C:\Program Files (x86)\Progress\Telerik JustMock). 

The example projects provide a hands-on approach, unit testing JustMock itself. The documentation is also available in PDF format which you can download from your [Telerik account](https://www.telerik.com/account/my-downloads).

If you need additional assistance, take a look at our [online JustMock forums](https://www.telerik.com/forums/justmock) or [contact support](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-tickets).
